           <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp &nbsp &nbspAmerican Airlines was started in 1930 via a union of more than eighty small airlines.[11]

The two organizations from which American Airlines was originated were Robertson Aircraft Corporation and Colonial Air Transport. The former was first created in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company The Aviation Corporation. This, in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as American Airways. In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system and was renamed American Airlines. Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing Trans World Airlines in 2001</p>

         <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Nepal Airlines Corporation (Nepali: नेपाल वायुसेवा निगम), formerly known as Royal Nepal Airlines (Nepali: शाही नेपाल वायुसेवा), is the flag carrier of Nepal. Founded in 1958, it is the oldest airline of the country. Out of its main base at Tribhuvan International Airport, Kathmandu, the airline operates domestic services within Nepal and medium-haul services in Asia. The airline's first aircraft was a Douglas DC-3, used to serve domestic routes and a handful of destinations in India. The airline acquired its first jet aircraft, Boeing 727s, in 1972. As of 25 August 2019,[1] the airline operates a fleet of thirteen aircraft. Since 2013, the airline has been on the list of air carriers banned in the European Union.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In 1970, RNAC acquired its first Hawker Siddeley HS-748 followed by Twin Otters in 1971 and Boeing 727s in 1972. Two Boeing 757s gradually replaced the airline's Boeing 727s in 1987.Royal Nepal Airlines Boeing 727-100 at Don Muang Airport in 1986 Nepal had 181,000 tourist visitors in 1985, of which 80 percent arrived by air. Royal Nepal Airlines carried 38 percent of these tourist passengers, but that number was down from the company's peak market share of 50 percent in 1979. Indian Airlines Corporation was RNAC's main competitor, but newer entrants in the business were also competing with RNAC for market share. These companies included Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa, which started direct Kathmandu-Frankfurt service in cooperation with RNAC in October 1987 and now, other airlines are also wanting to do so.At the time, Royal Nepal Airlines' network connected 38 domestic and 10 international destinations. RNAC was flying directly from Nepal to Hong Kong (home to many Gurkhas employed by the British Army) by 1988 using a Boeing 757. In April 1988, NAC and the Civil Aviation Administration of China cooperated to provide scheduled service between Kathmandu and Lhasa in the autonomous province of Tibet.[</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In 1927, William Boeing founded Boeing Air Transport to operate air mail routes under contract with the United States Post Office Department.In 1929, Boeing merged his company with Pratt & Whitney to form the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation (UATC) which then set about buying, in the space of just 28 months, Pacific Air Transport, Stout Air Services, VAL, and National Air Transport, as well as numerous equipment manufacturers at the same time.On March 28, 1931, UATC formed United Air Lines, Inc. as a holding company for its airline subsidiaries.

In late 2006, Continental Airlines and United had preliminary merger discussions.On April 16, 2010, those discussions resumed.The board of directors of Continental and UAL Corporation agreed on May 2, 2010, to combine operations, contingent upon shareholder and regulatory approval. On October 1, 2010, the UAL Corporation changed its name to United Continental Holdings, Inc.[29] The carriers planned to begin merging their operations in 2011.The merged airline began operating under a single air operator's certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration on November 30, 2011.On March 3, 2012, United and Continental merged their passenger service systems, frequent-flier programs, and websites, which virtually eliminated the Continental brand with the exception of its logo.On Thursday June 27, 2019, the parent company's name changed from United Continental Holdings to United Airlines Holdings</p>
